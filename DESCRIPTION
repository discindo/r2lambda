Title: Deploy R Scripts as AWS Lambda Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
 c(person(given = "Teofil",
             family = "Nakov",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "teofiln@gmail.com")
             )
Description: The goal of {r2lambda} is to make it easier to go from an R script 
    to a deployed AWS Lambda service. It does this by wrapping preexisting functionality
    from the `paws` and `lambdr` packages.
