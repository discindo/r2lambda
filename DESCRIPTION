Title: Deploy R Scripts as AWS Lambda Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
 c(person(given = "Teofil",
             family = "Nakov",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "teofiln@gmail.com")
             )
Description: The goal of `{r2lambda}` is to make it easier to go from an `R` script 
    to a deployed AWS Lambda function. It does this by wrapping preexisting functionality
    from the `{paws}` and `{lambdr}` packages.
