\usage{
build_lambda(
  tag,
  runtime_function,
  runtime_path,
  support_path = NULL,
  renvlock_path = NULL,
  dependencies = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tag}{A name for the Docker container and Lambda function}

\item{runtime_function}{name of the runtime function}

\item{runtime_path}{path to the script containing the runtime function}

\item{support_path}{path to the support files (if any). Either NULL 
(the default) if all needed code is in the same `runtime_path` script, or a 
character vector of paths to additional files needed by the runtime script.}

\item{renvlock_path}{path to the renv.lock file (if any). Default is NULL.}

\item{dependencies}{list of dependencies (if any). Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
build and tag lambda image locally
}
\details{
Use either `renvlock_path` or `dependencies` to install required
packages, not both. By default, both are `NULL`, so the Docker image will
have no additional packages installed.
}
